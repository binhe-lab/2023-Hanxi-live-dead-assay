This folder contains analyses for showing the initial staining patterns we observed when applying FungaLight to oxidative stress damaged _C. glabrata_ cells. Note that these are not exactly our first trial results, which suffer a lot more inconsistencies and abnormalities, due to our inexperience with the reagent and protocol in general. Rather, these are the "alpha" tests of the protocol after some preliminary tests, and represent at least "sensible" results, although with important caveats that we addressed in the later protocol optimization steps.
