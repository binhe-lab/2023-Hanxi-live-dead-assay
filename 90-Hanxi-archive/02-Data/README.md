# Data Organization

## Data Source
Flow cytometry data files were generated via Attune NxT Flow Cytometer in forms of FCS files. For FungaLight flow cytometry experiments, live population gate were drawn based
on the mock treated samples, and applied to all samples in the experiment. Gated event count was exported via Attune softwareâ€™s GUI in the form of a tsv file. Counts from CFU assays were
stored in forms of tables and later manually appended to the corresponding flow cytometry data. All relevant raw data are provided in this folder.

## Instruction for Obtaining Data
Original raw data generated from experimental work and obtained from experimental instruments. The raw data in this repository can be obtained by cloning. If additional raw data is needed, please contact hanxi-tang@uiowa.edu

## Figure Panel Coorespondance
Each data folder contains the dataset neccessary for generating a panel in the final figure. The data folder name and panel correspondance is as following:

Panel A - 121422_FUN1 Heated CgScKl
Panel B - 121422_FUN1 H2O2 Treated CgScKl
Panel C & Panel D - 022423_FUN1 H2O2 Treated + CFU
Panel E - 0323-0328_Fungalight Flow + CFU
